# UI/UX Redesign Plan

- [x] Update home.css: Adjust hero and features for new theme, add modern effects.
- [x] Update forms.css: Professional form styling with new colors.
- [x] Update show.css: Update product show pages for consistency.
- [x] Update other CSS files (receipt.css, profile.css, etc.) to match new theme.
- [ ] Update EJS partials (navbar.ejs, sidebar.ejs, footer.ejs) for improved structure if needed.
- [ ] Test responsiveness and run the app to verify changes.
- [ ] Final tweaks based on visual inspection.
